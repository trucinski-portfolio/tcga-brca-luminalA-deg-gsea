## Data Overview

Raw expression and clinical data were obtained from the UCSC Xena Browser
(TCGA-BRCA cohort).

### Raw Data (NOT tracked in Git)
The following files are required locally but are excluded from version control:

- TCGA BRCA HiSeqV2_PANCAN normalized expression matrix
- TCGA BRCA clinical metadata matrix

Expected local path:
data/raw/preprocessing_inputs/

These files can be downloaded from:
https://tcga-xena-hub.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/download/TCGA.BRCA.sampleMap%2FHiSeqV2_PANCAN.gz
https://tcga-xena-hub.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/download/TCGA.BRCA.sampleMap%2FBRCA_clinicalMatrix

### Processed Data
Intermediate processed files (metadata harmonization, ranked gene lists)
are generated by `01_preprocessing.ipynb` and saved to `data/processed/`.

### Final Outputs
Figures and tables used in analysis and reporting are stored in `results/`.
